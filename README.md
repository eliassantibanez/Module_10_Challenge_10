# Module_10_Challenge_10
#### This application consists a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. Results are plotted so that the reader can visually see the performance of each cryptocurrency.
---

## Technologies

This application uses the following libraries:
*  pandas as pd
*  hvplot.pandas
*  sklearn.cluster import KMeans
*  sklearn.decomposition import PCA
*  sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
---

## Installation Guide

This program will require familliarity with importing csv files via pandas and having all the libraries mentioned above installed in the user enviroment. 

---

## Usage

This application will show the user clustering methods and approached. The user will also see how we can reduce dimensionality through the PCA and find the best value. 

*  Import the Data 
*  Prepare the Data 
*  Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
*  Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
*  Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
*  Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
*  Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
*  Visualize and Compare the Results
